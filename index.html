      <h2>Year 10 student studying Computer Science</h2>
      <p>
        My aspirations for the future:<br />Computer Science- My interest in
        Computer Science began with learning how software and hardware drive the
        digital world. Through my GCSE course, I’ve gained valuable experience
        in programming, problem-solving, and understanding how computer systems
        operate. I enjoy writing code and finding efficient solutions to
        challenges, and I plan to continue building on these skills through
        further education, such as A-level Computer Science or a technical
        college course. In the future, I aim to pursue a career in
        technology—potentially in software development, artificial intelligence,
        or cybersecurity. I’m excited by the fast pace of innovation in this
        field and the opportunity to create programs and systems that have
        real-world impact. I also look forward to working on personal coding
        projects, learning new languages, and exploring how software can solve
        everyday problems.<br />
        Engineering- Alongside Computer Science, I have developed a strong
        interest in Engineering, supported by my strengths in Maths and Physics.
        I’m fascinated by how physical systems, structures, and machines are
        designed and built. Whether it’s through understanding electrical
        circuits or mechanical systems, I enjoy applying scientific principles
        to practical, real-world scenarios. Engineering appeals to me because it
        combines creativity with technical skill. In the future, I’d like to
        explore areas such as electrical, mechanical, or robotics engineering.
        I’m especially interested in how technology can be used to develop
        sustainable solutions, improve infrastructure, and innovate in fields
        like transportation and energy. By continuing to study both Computer
        Science and Engineering, I aim to build a career where I can combine
        software with hardware—designing intelligent systems, building
        innovative products, and helping to develop the future of engineering.
